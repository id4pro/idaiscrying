## Emphasis
Modifying text is so neat and easy. You can make your text bold, italic and strikethrough.

```
Using two asterisks **this text is bold**.  
Two underscores __work as well__.  
Let's make it *italic now*.  
You guessed it, _one underscore is also enough_.  
Can we combine **_both of that_?** Absolutely.
What if I want to ~~strikethrough~~?
